> echo "\n\nexport N_PREFIX=\$HOME/.local\nexport PATH=\$N_PREFIX/bin:\$PATH" >> ~/.zshrc
> source ~/.zshrc
> n lts
> corepack enable
> cd /path/to/core
> yarn
> ```

### Setup

> Installation is local and doesn't require root privileges.

To set up the project:

#### Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lidofinance/core.git lido-core
cd lido-core
```

#### Install Project Dependencies

```bash
yarn install
```

#### Verify Setup with Tests (Optional)

```bash
yarn test
```

If you encounter any issues during setup, please open an issue on GitHub.

## Repository Structure

### Contracts

Production contracts are located in the `/contracts` directory at the root of the project. Subdirectory names indicate
the Solidity version of the contracts they contain. For example, contracts in `/contracts/0.4.24` are written in
Solidity v0.4.24. Common interfaces and libraries shared by contracts of different versions are located in the
`/contracts/common` subdirectory.

### Tests

This repository uses both Hardhat and Foundry for testing:

- Hardhat offers greater flexibility for writing complex tests.
- Foundry's fuzzing capabilities provide better coverage of edge cases.

All tests are located in `/tests` at the root of the project. Each subdirectory name corresponds to the version of the
contract being tested, mirroring the `/contracts` directory structure. Integration, regression, and other non-unit tests
are placed into corresponding subdirectories, e.g., `/tests/integration`, `/tests/regression`, etc.

For creating mocks or harness contracts for external dependencies, refer to
the [Mocking and Harnessing Contracts](#mocking-and-harnessing-contracts) section for guidance.

#### Unit Tests

Unit tests are crucial for ensuring the functionality of individual contracts and their components. These tests should
be written using Hardhat and placed in the `/tests` directory. Each subdirectory should correspond to the version of the
contract being tested, mirroring the structure of the `/contracts` directory.

Follow the naming convention `*.test.ts` for unit test files, such as `myContract.test.ts`. This convention aids in the
easy identification and organization of tests.

> [!NOTE]
> The project utilizes the `hardhat-coverage` plugin to generate coverage reports. Foundry-based tests are not included
> in the coverage.

#### Integration Tests

Integration tests are located in the `/tests/integration` directory at the root of the project. These tests verify the
interaction between different contracts and their behavior in real-world scenarios. The naming convention for
integration tests follows the `*.integration.ts` postfix, for example, `myScenario.integration.ts`.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> To run integration tests, ensure you have a `.env` file in the root of the project. You can use the `.env.example`
> file as a template.

#### Fuzzing and Invariant Tests

Foundry's Solidity tests are specifically used for fuzzing library contracts or functions that perform complex
calculations or byte manipulation. These Solidity tests are located under `/tests` and organized into appropriate
subdirectories. The naming conventions follow
Foundry's [documentation](https://book.getfoundry.sh/tutorials/best-practices#general-test-guidance):

- For tests, use the `.t.sol` postfix (e.g., `MyContract.t.sol`).
- For scripts, use the `.s.sol` postfix (e.g., `MyScript.s.sol`).
- For helpers, use the `.h.sol` postfix (e.g., `MyHelper.h.sol`).

It is crucial to follow these naming conventions to distinguish Hardhat test files from Foundry-related files, ensuring
the proper execution of Hardhat tests.

#### Mocking and Harnessing Contracts

The `/tests` directory also contains contract mocks and helpers, which are placed in the `.../contracts` subdirectory,
e.g., `/tests/0.4.24/contracts`. Mocks and helpers do not need to be written using the same version of Solidity as the
contract being tested. For example, it is acceptable to have a mock contract written in Solidity v0.8.9 in
`/tests/0.4.24/contracts`.

- Use the `__Harness` postfix for wrappers that expose private functions of a contract and may include test-specific
  actions. For example, `MyContract__Harness.sol` or `MyContract__HarnessForAnotherContract.sol`.
- Use the `__Mock` postfix for contracts that simulate the behavior of the target contract. For example,
  `MyContract__Mock.sol` or `MyContract__MockForAnotherContract.sol`.

### Library

TypeScript utilities and helpers are located in the `/lib` directory at the root of the project. When adding a new file
to this directory, ensure you re-export all new modules from the `/lib/index.ts` file to maintain clean and organized
import statements.

### Typechain Types

The Typechain types are located in the `/typechain-types` directory at the root of the project.

> [!WARNING]
> Do not manually edit any files in this directory, as they are autogenerated with each compilation.

If you encounter issues with your IDE not properly indexing this directory and causing import errors, try the following
solutions:

- Open the `/typechain-types/index.ts` file to prompt the IDE to index it.
- Delete the `/typechain-types` directory and recompile the project using `yarn hardhat compile --force`.

### Configuration Files

All configuration files can be found in the root directory of the project. This includes files for environment
variables, build settings, and other project-specific configurations.

## Conventions

All contributions must adhere to the following established conventions.

### Solidity Code

- Must be auto-formatted using Solhint
- Generally follows the [Official Solidity Style Guide](https://docs.soliditylang.org/en/latest/style-guide.html), with
  some project-specific exceptions
- When writing new contracts, refer to existing ones for project-specific conventions, naming patterns, and formatting

### TypeScript Code

- Must be auto-formatted using ESLint
- Follow patterns and conventions established in the existing codebase for tests and scripts

### Commit Messages

- Must follow the [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) format

### Code Quality

- The repository includes a pre-commit hook that checks code formatting and commit message structure
- Resolve any issues flagged by the pre-commit hook before submitting a pull request

### Documentation

- Keep inline comments and documentation up-to-date with code changes
- For significant changes, update relevant sections of the project documentation

### Testing

- Write appropriate tests (unit tests, integration tests, and fuzzing tests) for new features or bug fixes
- Ensure all tests pass before submitting a pull request

Distinguishing Hardhat test files from Foundry-related files is crucial for proper test execution and maintaining code
consistency. For any questions, contact the maintainers.

## Branches

### `master`

This is the production branch and the default branch of the repository.
The [deployed protocol contracts](https://docs.lido.fi/deployed-contracts/) must match the contracts stored in the
`/contracts` directory. All pull requests to `master` must originate from the `develop` branch and require at least one
approving review before merging.

### `develop`

This is the main development branch. All pull requests to `master` should be submitted to `develop` first for peer
review.

## Local Deployment

WIP

## Tests

### Tracing

During Hardhat tests, the `hardhat-tracer` tool can trace contract calls and state changes, which is helpful for
debugging and analyzing contract interactions. However, full-scale transaction tracing is disabled by default to
maintain optimal test performance.

> [!NOTE]
> Tracing is supported only in Hardhat unit and integration tests using the Hardhat mainnet fork (see below for
> details).

To enable tracing:

- Wrap the code you want to trace with `Tracer.enable()` and `Tracer.disable()` functions.
- Run the tests with the appropriate command that enables tracing (e.g., `yarn test:trace`).

Here's an example:

```typescript
import { Tracer } from "test/suite";

describe("MyContract", () => {
  it("should do something", async () => {
    Tracer.enable();
    // code to trace
    Tracer.disable();
  });
});
```

### Running Unit Tests

Unit tests can be run in multiple ways, depending on your needs:

```bash
# Run all unit tests in parallel
yarn test

# Run all unit tests sequentially
yarn test:sequential

# Run all unit tests with trace logging (calls only)
yarn test:trace

# Run all unit tests with full trace logging (calls and storage operations)
yarn test:fulltrace

# Run all unit tests in watch mode (useful during development)
# Supports tracing; use .only in your test files to focus on specific tests
yarn test:watch

# Run all unit tests and generate a coverage report
yarn test:coverage
```

> [!TIP]
> The best way to run a single test or test suite is to use `.only` in the test file and run any test command except the
> parallel one.

### Running Fuzzing and Invariant Tests

Fuzzing and invariant tests help ensure that your contracts behave correctly under a wide range of inputs and
conditions. These tests are crucial for catching edge cases and potential vulnerabilities.

```bash
yarn test:foundry       # Run all Foundry-based fuzzing and invariant tests
```

### Running Integration Tests

Before running integration tests, ensure you have a `.env` file in the root of the project with the necessary
environment variables configured. You can use the `.env.example` file as a template.

There are several ways to run integration tests; choose the one that best fits your requirements.

#### On Mainnet Fork via Hardhat Network (with Tracing)

This is the most common method for running integration tests. It uses an instance of the Hardhat Network that forks the
mainnet environment, allowing you to run integration tests with trace logging.

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure that `MAINNET_FORKING_URL` and other `MAINNET_*` environment variables are set in the `.env` file (refer to
> `.env.example` for guidance).

```bash
# Run all integration tests
yarn test:integration

# Run all integration tests with trace logging (calls only)
yarn test:integration:trace

# Run all integration tests with full trace logging (calls and storage operations)
yarn test:integration:fulltrace
```

#### On Mainnet Fork Using Separate Ethereum Development Environment (without Tracing)

This method is suitable for running integration tests on a local mainnet fork using an alternative Ethereum node, such
as Anvil. Tracing is not supported in this setup.

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure that `MAINNET_RPC_URL` and other `MAINNET_*` environment variables are configured in the `.env` file.

```bash
# Run integration tests on a local mainnet fork
yarn test:integration:fork:mainnet
```

#### On Scratch Deployment of Protocol via Hardhat Network (with Tracing)

This method allows you to run integration tests against a scratch deployment on the Hardhat Network. Deployment scripts
will be automatically executed.

> [!NOTE]
> This approach runs integration tests against a local Hardhat scratch deployment instead of a mainnet fork. Ensure that
> `DEPLOYER`, `GENESIS_TIME`, `GAS_PRIORITY_FEE`, and `GAS_MAX_FEE` are set in the `.env` file.

For more details, refer to the [Scratch Deploy](./docs/scratch-deploy.md) documentation.

```bash
# Run all integration tests against a scratch deployment
yarn test:integration:scratch

# Run all integration tests with trace logging (calls only)
yarn test:integration:scratch:trace

# Run all integration tests with full trace logging (calls and storage operations)
yarn test:integration:scratch:fulltrace
```

#### On Scratch Deployment of Protocol via Local Ethereum Development Environment (e.g., Anvil, Hardhat Network, Ganache) (without Tracing)

This method enables you to run integration tests against a local deployment using alternative Ethereum nodes like Anvil,
Hardhat Network, or Ganache. Tracing is not supported in this setup.

> [!NOTE]
> Ensure that a local deployment is running on port `8555` and that the `deployed-local.json` file with the deployed
> addresses is available. This file is automatically generated during the scratch deployment process. Refer
> to [scratch-deploy.md](./docs/scratch-deploy.md) for more details. This setup is controlled by the `LOCAL_RPC_URL` and
> `LOCAL_*` environment variables.

```bash
# Run integration tests against a local deployment
yarn test:integration:fork:local
```

## Adding CI/CD Integration Tests Workflow to Other Repositories

To integrate the core repository's integration tests into other repositories using GitHub Actions, you can follow the
example workflow below. This workflow demonstrates how to set up and run integration tests from the core repository in
another repository.

By default, the workflow will run the integration tests against the latest version of the deployed protocol on Ethereum
Mainnet utilizing contract addresses from [deployed protocol contracts](https://docs.lido.fi/deployed-contracts/).
